## Files Description

- **src/main.cpp**: The entry point of the application. It initializes the program and calls functions from the `utils` module.
- **src/utils.cpp**: Implements utility functions declared in the `utils.h` header file.
- **include/utils.h**: Declares the utility functions that are implemented in `utils.cpp`.
- **Makefile**: Contains the build instructions for the project.
